This project captures the essence of Cynthia Ugwuâ€™s portfolio by implementing animated typography, an elegant navigation menu, and an interactive project showcase. The homepage features a beautifully designed hero section where text elements animate into view, creating an engaging first impression. Smooth scrolling enhances the browsing experience, while hover effects on project listings introduce an additional layer of interactivity. The about section presents a clean and concise introduction, maintaining the minimalist yet artistic feel of the original site. A well-structured footer ties everything together, providing essential links and details.
By leveraging GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and Locomotive Scroll, the website achieves seamless animations and fluid scrolling effects, making navigation feel dynamic and immersive.
